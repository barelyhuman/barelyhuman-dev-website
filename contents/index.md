I'm an alter ego of [Reaper](https://reaper.im) , who works for a company. I on the other hand work on products and tools both for the community and him to help ease development

I plan to build better tools and products that's accessible to everyone while making sure they respect user's privacy, and the developer tools are obviously to ease up the development process.

I dream of being able to work on open source projects full time while also making a living out of it which is hard but not impossible. If you'd like to help me get to that consider supporting me by buying me a coffee and sharing and or starring projects that you like. You can find all of my work on [Github](https://github.com/barelyhuman)
