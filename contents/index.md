A developer that's working on ways to build accessible products for everyone though focusing a little more on the Indian Market.
These include tools that can be categorised under productivity, development, utilities and more.

I'm basically an alternative identity of [Reaper](https://reaper.im) , who works for a company right now.

The plan is to build tools that are both well built and privacy focused while also trying to keep them nominal in price.

I dream of being able to work on such projects full time but that needs support from people who use these products.
